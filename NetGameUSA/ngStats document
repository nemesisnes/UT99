ngStats.cfg file and manually make put the settings back.

Unzip this patch archive into your UnrealTournament directory making sure to maintain is directory structure.

**** SPECIAL NOTE FOR TIMEZONE GMT 0:00 USERS ****

If you are experiencing the Time Zone GMT 0:00 bug (UK users for example) where ngStats will not show any games played you will need to 
delete your database before playing UT after application of this patch. DO NOT follow this procedure unless this is the problem you were 
getting the patch for as it will COMPLETELY erase your local ngStats. Just install the patch and play UT and you will be fine. If your games
showed up just fine and you are just upgrading DO NOT delete your databases! If this is your problem, however, here is what you need to do:

After installing the patch but before playing UT again go to your UnrealTournament\NetGamesUSA.com\ngStats\data\ directory and delete all the 
.db files you find in this directory. Next time you play UT and view your ngStats they will be working properly.

**************************************************

The history.txt file located in the NetGamesUSA.com/ngStats directory contains a list of fixes for ngStats. The ngWorldStats.exe is also updated 
in this patch to version 1.5.4 and fixes several issues with servers reporting they were ngWorldStats enabled when they were in fact experiencing 
problems.
