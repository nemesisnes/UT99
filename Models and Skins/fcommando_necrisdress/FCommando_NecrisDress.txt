Description:
------------
- The "Female Commando > Necris" wearing a mini skirt and small top, so you can enjoy the view of her cleavage.
- Made by Epic, its an early prototype of the "Female Commando > Necris" Skin.
- But with MY major corrections and alterations to the skins.
- I found this in the unused texturefile "Gothfem.utx".
- Team colours with 4 familiar faces, 3 new faces, all with eyes!
