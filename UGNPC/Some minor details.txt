It contains a number of NPCs - all subclassed from UnrealShare.Bots - some are friendly to the Player, some not so much! They are :-

[These three Skaarj are not friendly - inf means Infantry]
UGNPC.Dominus (skaarj inf with ripper)
UGNPC.Eradicus (skaarj inf with UT flak cannon)
UGNPC.Vindicus (skaarj inf with RL)

[These two humans are not friendly]
UGNPC.Arcturus (human male with 8ball firing explosive grenades)
UGNPC.Dante (human male with pulse rifle)

[These four humans are friendly and will follow/support the Player]
UGNPC.Ash (supportive human male with stinger)
UGNPC.Rhiannon (supportive human female with shock rifle)
UGNPC.Sonya (supportive human female with UT minigun)
UGNPC.Kurgan (supportive human male no weapon - NOT USE [this means I don't use it in MonsterSpawn as it has no weapon])

So they all have specific attitudes to the Player; they all carry specific/individual weapons; they all say specific/individual things on specific actions (FirstSee, FirstHit, Ignore, etc, etc) so, for example, Rhiannon says "What are you up to?" when first meeting the Player (in text, not an actual voice); they all have names. They don't respawn when killed but their health regenerates by what looks like 1HP per sec when damaged. They don't appear in the Scoreboard in DM nor as Players in MH.
